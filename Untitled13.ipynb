    "SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "They have a predefined schema that defines the structure of the data, including tables, columns, and relationships.\n",
    "SQL databases ensure data integrity through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, providing strong consistency and transactional support.\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.\n",
    "SQL databases are well-suited for applications requiring complex queries, transactions, and strict consistency requirements.\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "They do not require a fixed schema, allowing flexibility in storing different types of data.\n",
    "NoSQL databases typically offer eventual consistency rather than strong consistency, making them suitable for distributed systems and scalability.\n",
    "Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, etc.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are commonly used in applications needing high availability, horizontal scalability, and real-time data processing.\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are relational, have a structured schema, provide strong consistency, and are suitable for applications with complex queries and transactions. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational, schema-less or flexible schema, offer eventual consistency, and are preferred for handling large-scale, distributed data with high availability and scalability requirements. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on specific project requirements, such as data structure, scalability needs, and performance characteristics.\n",

    "A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identify each row (record) in a table.\n",
    "It must contain unique values for each row, and it cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "There can be only one Primary Key constraint defined for a table.\n",
    "Primary Keys are used to enforce entity integrity and ensure that each record in a table can be uniquely identified.\n",

    "Foreign Key constraints ensure referential integrity, meaning that values in the Foreign Key column(s) must exist as Primary Key values in the referenced table or be NULL.\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "    department_id INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "In this example, department_id in the employees table is a Foreign Key that references the department_id Primary Key in the departments table. This establishes a relationship between the employees and departments tables based on the department that each employee belongs to.\n",
